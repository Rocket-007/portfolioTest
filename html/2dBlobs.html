            <h1>2d Blobs(fisrt game) — 9/2020</h1>

            <h3>A 2d platformer shooter game(with cool and bright graphics)</h3>

            <p>
                This is the very first well pulished game progect i 
                made while learnig love 2d and programing on my <a href="https://rocket-007.github.io/myPhoneSpec">mobile</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Others would have gone for something simple like astroids or a very basic platfomer (with a white cube as the player)
                for there first game,
                but I gave myself a way bigger project even it being at the very early stage of me learning love2d and lua B-).
            </p>

            <p>
                Because this project was done entirely without a pc,
                there were very big issues like:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>map editing</li>
                <li>gamestates design</li>
                <li>sound implementation</li>
                <li>graphics design and assets creation</li>
                <li>enemy ai</li>
                <li>game controls</li>
                <li>ui design</li>
                <li>character selection</li>
                <li>apk packaging and signing…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                …But even without the support a pc, after 2 MONTHS the game project was completed,
                with a ton of help form my brother in the arts department
            </p>

                    Fixing a very terrible bug that threatened the project at the early stage of development.
                    The window would clip a small piece of it self to the left top corner of the screen, leaving the wireframe of the collision blocks.
                    The bug happened when i (inevitably) scaled the camera aand map to values like 0.1, 0.2,…0.9

                    More progress…
                    BTW, one mobile there is no windows or menu for debugging on the console so i have to manually
                    place my variables on the screen so i can debug, and thats why my screen is so messy in development(and I also think it looks cool B-))
